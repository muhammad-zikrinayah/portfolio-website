      , someone who combines creativity in UI/UX Design with technical skills in
      Front-End Development. I enjoy every step of the process, from designing
      intuitive interfaces to implementing them using web frameworks like React
      JS and Tailwind CSS. For mobile development, I have a good understanding
      of Flutter. My hobby in photography also trains me to always pay attention
      to detail and aesthetics in visual design.
